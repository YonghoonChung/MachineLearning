Photo OCR
    Problem Description and Pipeline
        Photo OCR : Photo Opitcal Character Recognition
            focuses on how to get computers to read the text to the purest in images
        1. Detect where the text is located
        2. Read the text

        OCR pipeline
            0. Image
            1. Text detection
            2. Character segmentation
            3. Character classification/recognition
        
    Sliding Windows
        Pedestrian detection
            height & width ratio -> rectangle

            step-size / stride -> stepping rectangle to see whether pedestrian is appeared in images
                small rectangle to larger rectangle

            this technique is called sliding windows

        1D Sliding window for character segmentation
            detect characters by sliding windows
                do black/white color -> place characters white
                check whether character is mid-point of two characters

    Getting Lots of Data and Artificial Data
        Reliable way -> low bias learning algorithm and train it on a massive training set
        where to get data?
            1. create new data
            2. use the previous dataset

        Synthesizing data by introducing distortion
        
        1. Make sure you have a low bias classifier before expending the effort.
        2. "How much work would it be to get 10x as much data as we currently have?"
            - Artificial data synthesis
            - Collect / label it yourself
            - "Crowd source"

    Ceiling Analysis: What Part of the Pipeline to Work
        Estimating the errors due to each component
            checking each steps with accuracy
                Overall system -> 72%
                text detection -> 89%
                ...

        Face recognition
            Camera image -> Preprocess (remove background) -> Face detection ->(Eyes, Nose, Mouth segmentation) -> Logistic regression -> Label
